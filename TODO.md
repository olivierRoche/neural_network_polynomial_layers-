# TODO
- [x] Make learning process more stable.
- [x] Implement method BatchLearning for class PolyNN
- [ ] Make ap.differential effective
- [ ] Create a class for polyfunc
- [ ] implement cache in backpropagation (this should be delivered by polyfunc)
- [ ] Make PolyNN compatible with any threshold function
- [ ] Integrate into Tensorflow
